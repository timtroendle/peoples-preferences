    Conjoint survey experiments have become a popular method for analyzing
    multidimensional preferences in political science. If properly implemented,
    conjoint experiments can obtain reliable measures of multidimensional
    preferences and estimate causal effects of multiple attributes on
    hypothetical choices or evaluations. This chapter provides an accessible
    overview of the methodology for designing, implementing, and analyzing
    conjoint survey experiments. Specifically, we begin by detailing a
    substantive example: How do candidate attributes affect the support of
    American respondents for candidates running against President Trump in 2020?
    We then discuss the theoretical underpinnings and advantages of conjoint
    designs. We next provide guidelines for practitioners in designing and
    analyzing conjoint survey experiments. We conclude by discussing further
    design considerations, common conjoint applications, common criticisms, and
    possible future directions.

    Energy’s central place in economic, political and social systems—and the
    broad impacts that energy choices have on the natural world and public
    health—mean that new technologies often spur public reactions. Understanding
    these public responses and their drivers is important, as public support can
    influence new technology adoption and deployment. Here I review the
    literature on public perceptions of and responses to a wide range of new
    energy technologies. Unlike previous reviews that tend to focus on
    particular technologies or types of technologies, this Review covers both
    large-scale energy infrastructure projects, such as utility-scale wind and
    solar, fossil fuel extraction and marine renewables, as well as small-scale,
    ‘consumer-facing’ technologies such as electric vehicles, rooftop solar and
    smart meters. This approach reveals broad trends that may facilitate
    communication between policymakers, technologists and the public, and
    support the transition to a more sustainable energy system.

    Public support is a key determinant of whether any energy project is
    developed in democratic countries. In recent decades, scholars have
    extensively examined levels of support and opposition to energy
    infrastructure, often with a focus on so-called Not-in-My-Backyard (NIMBY)
    sentiments. As the need for energy infrastructure grows, so does the need to
    extract insights and lessons from this literature. In this systematic
    literature review, we evaluate decades of research to identify important
    trends in topical focus, research findings, and research design. We find a
    disproportionate focus on wind energy, followed by solar, fossil fuels, and
    transmission, with most studies conducted in the United States or United
    Kingdom, and that individuals are more often supportive of energy projects
    than they are opposed. Scholars have examined the role of many factors in
    understanding attitudes toward energy infrastructure, and often find
    knowledge, trust, and positive perceptions about the benefits of projects to
    be positively correlated with support for projects, although with variation
    across energy types. NIMBY attitudes differ widely in approach and are often
    plagued by problematic research designs that limit inferences and the
    generalizability of findings. We provide a detailed discussion of these
    limitations and suggest areas in which the literature can expand.

    Energy security is an important policy goal for most countries. Here, we
    show that cross-country differences in concern about energy security across
    Israel and 22 countries in Europe are explained by energy-specific and
    general national contextual indicators, over-and-above individual-level
    factors that reflect population demographics. Specifically, public concerns
    about import dependency and affordability reflect the specific energy
    context within countries, such as dependency on energy imports and
    electricity costs, while higher concerns about the affordability,
    vulnerability and reliability of energy are associated with higher fossil
    fuel consumption. More general national context beyond energy also appears
    to matter; energy security concerns are higher in countries that are doing
    less well in terms of economic and human well-being. These findings indicate
    that wider energy, social and economic context influence people’s feelings
    of vulnerability and sense of security, which may inform the development of
    effective energy security strategies that assuage public concerns.

    Survey experiments are a core tool for causal inference. Yet, the design of
    classical survey experiments prevents them from identifying which components
    of a multidimensional treatment are influential. Here, we show how
                  conjoint analysis
                  , an experimental design yet to be widely applied in political science, enables researchers to estimate the causal effects of multiple treatment components and assess several causal hypotheses simultaneously. In conjoint analysis, respondents score a set of alternatives, where each has randomly varied attributes. Here, we undertake a formal identification analysis to integrate conjoint analysis with the potential outcomes framework for causal inference. We propose a new causal estimand and show that it can be nonparametrically identified and easily estimated from conjoint data using a fully randomized design. The analysis enables us to propose diagnostic checks for the identification assumptions. We then demonstrate the value of these techniques through empirical applications to voter decision making and attitudes toward immigrants.

    In the Netherlands, a large ongoing study seeks to provide insight into the
    process behind preferences and choices with regard to moving and housing. As
    part of the development of the survey instrument that was used in this
    study, we examined whether visual images (such as photographs) should be
    included, since they may clarify particular attributes (e.g., architectural
    style) and make the choice task more realistic for the respondents. However,
    images may disturb the results as respondents may evaluate accidental
    details on the photographs such as the color of the window frames. This
    paper presents the results of two subsequent pilot studies on the impact of
    including images in a web-based questionnaire. In the first study, eight
    dwelling profiles were presented in three different ways ("text only", "text
    and color photo" and "text and black-and-white impression") to 28
    respondents. In the second study two different instruments were used: one
    with written information and directly shown photo-collages; the other with
    written information and photo-collages on request only. Both studies showed
    that the inclusion of images led to a number of differences between the
    results obtained with the various presentation methods. These differences
    may be explained by accidental details on the images. Furthermore, dwelling
    characteristics appear to be more important to the respondents' overall
    evaluation of a dwelling when shown with photos than when presented in
    written format. However, since including images also has a substantial
    number of benefits, it may not be advisable to leave out images completely
    from the measurement task. Should images be included in a survey instrument,
    it is of utmost importance to make sure that all potentially disturbing
    details are cleared away. Furthermore, it may be better to show a collage of
    pictures than only one in order to decrease the specific impact of
    accidental details.

    Existing research offers a nuanced understanding of the conditions under
    which firms can gain a competitive advantage through environmental business
    conduct. However, we know quite little about whether such action can also
    generate benefits for firms induced by political action, such as benefits
    associated with public procurement, (softer) regulatory enforcement and
    corporate tax breaks. We argue that citizens are more likely to support such
    rewards for firms that have a stronger record of environmental business
    conduct, express stronger commitment to future environmental action and
    submit such action to independent audits. The empirical analysis focuses on
    vehicle emissions reduction by car producers and plastic waste reduction by
    retailers. Choice experiments with 6726 respondents from Germany and the
    United States support these arguments. Our findings are surprisingly
    consistent across two different sociocultural and political contexts
    (Germany, USA), two different environmental policy domains (vehicle
    emissions, plastic waste) and three forms of political rewards. Whereas
    studies focusing on narrowly defined economic benefits (competitiveness) of
    environmental business conduct have become somewhat more sceptical about the
    magnitude and scope of such benefits, our results provide more room for
    optimism by pointing to other types of benefits of corporate environmental
    action.

    Conjoint analysis is a common tool for studying political preferences. The
    method disentangles patterns in respondents’ favorability toward complex,
    multidimensional objects, such as candidates or policies. Most conjoints
    rely upon a fully randomized design to generate average marginal component e
    ects (AMCEs). They measure the degree to which a given value of a conjoint
    profile feature increases, or decreases, respondents’ support for the
    overall profile relative to a baseline, averaging across all respondents and
    other features. While the AMCE has a clear causal interpretation (about the
    e ect of features), most published conjoint analyses also use AMCEs to
    describe levels of favorability. This o en means comparing AMCEs among
    respondent subgroups. We show that using conditional AMCEs to describe the
    degree of subgroup agreement can be misleading as regression interactions
    are sensitive to the reference category used in the analysis. This leads to
    inferences about subgroup di erences in preferences that have arbitrary
    sign, size, and significance. We demonstrate the problem using examples
    drawn from published articles and provide suggestions for improved reporting
    and interpretation using marginal means and an omnibus F-test. Given the
    accelerating use of these designs in political science, we o er advice for
    best practice in analysis and presentation of results.

  abstract: >-
    We briefly review and discuss traditional conjoint analysis (CA) and
    discrete choice experiments (DCEs), widely used stated preference
    elicitation methods in several disciplines. We pay particular attention to
    the origins and basis of CA, and show that it is generally inconsistent with
    economic demand theory, and is subject to several logical inconsistencies
    that make it unsuitable for use in applied economics, particularly welfare
    and policy assessment. We contrast this with DCEs that have a long-standing,
    well-tested theoretical basis in random utility theory, and we show why and
    how DCEs are more general and consistent with economic demand theory.
    Perhaps the major message, though, is that many studies that claim to be
    doing conjoint analysis are really doing DCE.

    Progress in science relies in part on generating hypotheses with existing
    observations and testing hypotheses with new observations. This distinction
    between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not
    respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of
    predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary
    biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid
    this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and
    analysis plan before observing the research outcomes—a process called
    preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that
    result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety
    of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of
    preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application,
    such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for
    preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the
    practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase
    distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and
    will improve the credibility of research findings.

    Coal-fired power generation is the single most important source of carbon
    dioxide emissions in many countries, including Germany. A government
    commission recently proposed to phase out coal by 2038, which implies that
    the country will miss its 2020 climate target. On the basis of a choice
    experiment that assessed 31,744 hypothetical policy scenarios in a
    representative sample of German voters, we show that voters prefer a
    phase-out by 2025. They would uphold their support for greater climate
    ambition up to an additional cost to society of (sic)8.5 billion. Voters in
    Rhineland and Lusatia, the country's main coal regions, also support an
    earlier phase-out, but to a lesser extent than voters in other regions. By
    demonstrating that political decision-makers are more reluctant than voters
    in overcoming energy path dependence, our analysis calls for further
    research to explain the influence of particular stakeholders in slowing
    energy transitions.

    Statistical modeling is a powerful tool for developing and testing theories
    by way of causal explanation, prediction, and description. In many
    disciplines there is near-exclusive use of statistical modeling for causal
    explanation and the assumption that models with high explanatory power are
    inherently of high predictive power. Conflation between explanation and
    prediction is common, yet the distinction must be understood for progressing
    scientific knowledge. While this distinction has been recognized in the
    philosophy of science, the statistical literature lacks a thorough
    discussion of the many differences that arise in the process of modeling for
    an explanatory versus a predictive goal. The purpose of this article is to
    clarify the distinction between explanatory and predictive modeling, to
    discuss its sources, and to reveal the practical implications of the
    distinction to each step in the modeling process.

    In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite
    empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive
    findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting
    dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a
    researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists
    than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer
    simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how
    unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant
    evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and
    straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The
    solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines
    for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication
    process.

    Public support is usually a precondition for the adoption and successful
    implementation of costly policies. We argue that such support is easier to
    achieve with policy-packages that incorporate primary and ancillary
    measures. We specifically distinguish command-andcontrol and market-based
    measures as primary measures and argue that the former will usually garner
    more public support than the latter given the low-visibility tendency of
    costs associated with command-and-control measures. Nevertheless, if
    included in a policypackage, ancillary measures are likely to increase
    public support by reducing negative effects of primary measures. Based on a
    choice experiment with a representative sample of 2,034 Swiss citizens, we
    assessed these arguments with respect to political efforts to reduce vehicle
    emissions. The empirical analysis supported the argument that
    policypackaging affects public support positively, particularly generating
    more support when ancillary measures are added. Lastly, we ultimately
    observe that command-and-control measures obtain more public support than
    market-based instruments.
