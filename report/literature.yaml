    This paper briefly introduces choice experiments using R, which is a
    language and environment for statistical computing. Choice experiments
    belong to the family of stated preference methods and are applied to
    numerous issues in research fields such as marketing science, transportation
    economics, environmental economics, agricultural economics, or health
    economics. We explain the process of creating choice sets using the
    AlgDesign package and the process of statistically analyzing responses using
    the survival package. Since R is free software, readers of this document may
    find it easy to apply choice experiments to their research projects.

    The authors use conjoint analysis to provide interval-level estimates of
    part-worths allowing tradeoffs among attribute levels to be examined.
    Researchers often possess prior information about the part-worths, such as
    the order and range restrictions of product attribute levels. It is known,
    for example, that consumers would rather pay less for a specific product
    given that all other product attribute levels are unchanged. The authors
    present a Bayesian approach to incorporate prior ordinal information about
    these part-worths into the analysis of conjoint studies. Their method
    results in parameter estimates with greater face validity and predictive
    performance than estimates that do not utilize prior information or those
    that use traditional methods such as LINMAP. Unlike existing methods, the
    authors' methods apply to both rating and choice-based conjoint studies.

    Hierarchical Bayes models free researchers from computational constraints
    and allow for the development of more realistic models of buyer behavior and
    decision making. Moreover, this freedom enables exploration of marketing
    problems that have proven elusive over the years, such as models for
    advertising ROI, sales force effectiveness, and similarly complex problems
    that often involve simultaneity.  The promise of Bayesian statistical
    methods lies in the ability to deal with these complex problems, but the
    very complexity of the problems creates a significant challenge to both
    researchers and practitioners.   We illustrate the promise of HB models and
    provide an introduction to their computation.

    Conjoint survey experiments have become a popular method for analyzing
    multidimensional preferences in political science. If properly implemented,
    conjoint experiments can obtain reliable measures of multidimensional
    preferences and estimate causal effects of multiple attributes on
    hypothetical choices or evaluations. This chapter provides an accessible
    overview of the methodology for designing, implementing, and analyzing
    conjoint survey experiments. Specifically, we begin by detailing a
    substantive example: How do candidate attributes affect the support of
    American respondents for candidates running against President Trump in 2020?
    We then discuss the theoretical underpinnings and advantages of conjoint
    designs. We next provide guidelines for practitioners in designing and
    analyzing conjoint survey experiments. We conclude by discussing further
    design considerations, common conjoint applications, common criticisms, and
    possible future directions.

    Energy’s central place in economic, political and social systems—and the
    broad impacts that energy choices have on the natural world and public
    health—mean that new technologies often spur public reactions. Understanding
    these public responses and their drivers is important, as public support can
    influence new technology adoption and deployment. Here I review the
    literature on public perceptions of and responses to a wide range of new
    energy technologies. Unlike previous reviews that tend to focus on
    particular technologies or types of technologies, this Review covers both
    large-scale energy infrastructure projects, such as utility-scale wind and
    solar, fossil fuel extraction and marine renewables, as well as small-scale,
    ‘consumer-facing’ technologies such as electric vehicles, rooftop solar and
    smart meters. This approach reveals broad trends that may facilitate
    communication between policymakers, technologists and the public, and
    support the transition to a more sustainable energy system.

    Public support is a key determinant of whether any energy project is
    developed in democratic countries. In recent decades, scholars have
    extensively examined levels of support and opposition to energy
    infrastructure, often with a focus on so-called Not-in-My-Backyard (NIMBY)
    sentiments. As the need for energy infrastructure grows, so does the need to
    extract insights and lessons from this literature. In this systematic
    literature review, we evaluate decades of research to identify important
    trends in topical focus, research findings, and research design. We find a
    disproportionate focus on wind energy, followed by solar, fossil fuels, and
    transmission, with most studies conducted in the United States or United
    Kingdom, and that individuals are more often supportive of energy projects
    than they are opposed. Scholars have examined the role of many factors in
    understanding attitudes toward energy infrastructure, and often find
    knowledge, trust, and positive perceptions about the benefits of projects to
    be positively correlated with support for projects, although with variation
    across energy types. NIMBY attitudes differ widely in approach and are often
    plagued by problematic research designs that limit inferences and the
    generalizability of findings. We provide a detailed discussion of these
    limitations and suggest areas in which the literature can expand.

    Many students, especially in econometrics, express frustration with the way
    a problem known as “bad control” is evaded, if not mishandled, in the
    traditional literature. The problem arises when the addition of a variable
    to a regression equation produces an unintended discrepancy between the
    regression coefficient and the effect that the coefficient is expected to
    represent. Avoiding such discrepancies presents a challenge not only to
    practitioners of econometrics, but to all analysts in the data intensive
    sciences. This note describes graphical tools for understanding,
    visualizing, and resolving the problem through a series of illustrative
    examples. We have found that the examples presented here can serve as a
    powerful instructional device to supplement formal discussions of the
    problem. By making this “crash course” accessible to instructors and
    practitioners, we hope to avail these tools to a broader community of
    scientists concerned with the causal interpretation of regression models.

    Cross-national analyses test hypotheses about the drivers of global
    variation in national outcomes. However, since nations are connected in
    various ways, such as via spatial proximity and shared cultural ancestry,
    cross-national analyses often violate assumptions of non-independence,
    inflating false positive rates. Here, we show that, despite being recognised
    as an important statistical pitfall for over 200 years, cross-national
    research in economics and psychology still does not sufficiently account for
    non-independence. In a review of the 100 highest-cited cross-national
    studies of economic development and values, we find that controls for
    non-independence are rare. When studies do include controls for
    non-independence, our simulations suggest that commonly used methods
    continue to produce false positives. In reanalyses of twelve cross-national
    relationships, we show that half are no longer significant after controlling
    for non-independence using global proximity matrices. We urge social
    scientists to sufficiently control for non-independence in cross-national
    research.

    Energy security is an important policy goal for most countries. Here, we
    show that cross-country differences in concern about energy security across
    Israel and 22 countries in Europe are explained by energy-specific and
    general national contextual indicators, over-and-above individual-level
    factors that reflect population demographics. Specifically, public concerns
    about import dependency and affordability reflect the specific energy
    context within countries, such as dependency on energy imports and
    electricity costs, while higher concerns about the affordability,
    vulnerability and reliability of energy are associated with higher fossil
    fuel consumption. More general national context beyond energy also appears
    to matter; energy security concerns are higher in countries that are doing
    less well in terms of economic and human well-being. These findings indicate
    that wider energy, social and economic context influence people’s feelings
    of vulnerability and sense of security, which may inform the development of
    effective energy security strategies that assuage public concerns.

    Conjoint analysis is marketers’ favorite methodology for finding out how
    buyers make tradeoffs among competing products and suppliers. Conjoint
    analysts develop and present descriptions of alternative products or
    services that are prepared from fractional factorial, experimental designs.
    They use various models to infer buyers’ partworths for attribute levels,
    and enter the partworths into buyer choice simulators to predict how buyers
    will choose among products and services. Easy-to-use software has been
    important for applying these models. Thousands of applications of conjoint
    analysis have been carried out over the past three decades.

  abstract: "The moving shadows caused by wind turbines, referred to as “shadow flicker” (“SF”), are known to generate annoyance in a subset of the exposed population. However, the relationship between the level of modeled SF exposure and the population's perceived SF and SF annoyance is poorly understood. Improved understanding of SF exposure impacts could provide a basis for exposure thresholds and, in turn, potentially improve community acceptance of and experience with wind power projects. This study modeled SF exposure at nearly 35,000 residences across 61 wind projects in the United States, 747 of which were also survey respondents. Using these results, we analyzed the factors that led to perceived SF and self-reported SF annoyance. We found that perceived SF is primarily an objective response to SF exposure, distance to the closest turbine, and whether the respondent moved in after the wind project was built. Conversely, SF annoyance was not significantly correlated with SF exposure. Rather, SF annoyance is primarily a subjective response to wind turbine aesthetics, annoyance to other anthropogenic sounds, level of education, and age of the respondent. We also examined regulations governing SF in the sample project areas and compared them to SF exposure in the surrounding population. Additionally, we found that noise limits could serve as a proxy for SF exposure, as 90% of those exposed to wind turbine sound of no more than 45 dBA L1h had SF exposure of less than 8\_h per year (a prototypical EU regulatory threshold)."

    Survey experiments are a core tool for causal inference. Yet, the design of
    classical survey experiments prevents them from identifying which components
    of a multidimensional treatment are influential. Here, we show how
                  conjoint analysis
                  , an experimental design yet to be widely applied in political science, enables researchers to estimate the causal effects of multiple treatment components and assess several causal hypotheses simultaneously. In conjoint analysis, respondents score a set of alternatives, where each has randomly varied attributes. Here, we undertake a formal identification analysis to integrate conjoint analysis with the potential outcomes framework for causal inference. We propose a new causal estimand and show that it can be nonparametrically identified and easily estimated from conjoint data using a fully randomized design. The analysis enables us to propose diagnostic checks for the identification assumptions. We then demonstrate the value of these techniques through empirical applications to voter decision making and attitudes toward immigrants.

    In the Netherlands, a large ongoing study seeks to provide insight into the
    process behind preferences and choices with regard to moving and housing. As
    part of the development of the survey instrument that was used in this
    study, we examined whether visual images (such as photographs) should be
    included, since they may clarify particular attributes (e.g., architectural
    style) and make the choice task more realistic for the respondents. However,
    images may disturb the results as respondents may evaluate accidental
    details on the photographs such as the color of the window frames. This
    paper presents the results of two subsequent pilot studies on the impact of
    including images in a web-based questionnaire. In the first study, eight
    dwelling profiles were presented in three different ways ("text only", "text
    and color photo" and "text and black-and-white impression") to 28
    respondents. In the second study two different instruments were used: one
    with written information and directly shown photo-collages; the other with
    written information and photo-collages on request only. Both studies showed
    that the inclusion of images led to a number of differences between the
    results obtained with the various presentation methods. These differences
    may be explained by accidental details on the images. Furthermore, dwelling
    characteristics appear to be more important to the respondents' overall
    evaluation of a dwelling when shown with photos than when presented in
    written format. However, since including images also has a substantial
    number of benefits, it may not be advisable to leave out images completely
    from the measurement task. Should images be included in a survey instrument,
    it is of utmost importance to make sure that all potentially disturbing
    details are cleared away. Furthermore, it may be better to show a collage of
    pictures than only one in order to decrease the specific impact of
    accidental details.

    Local opposition to wind energy projects in Europe and North America is
    growing. This often causes project delays or even failure. Financial
    benefits may be one way to counteract a lack of community support. This
    analysis seeks to explain how discounted electricity, payments to the
    municipality, and payments for social purposes shift the acceptance of
    communities about a local wind energy project. A choice-based conjoint
    analysis among 811 German citizens showed that financial benefits increase
    citizens’ acceptance of a hypothetical wind energy project in the close
    vicinity of their homes. Proponents and the large group of citizens with
    rather weak preferences for local wind energy projects appreciate all tested
    benefits. In contrast, benefits cannot win over the small group of
    opponents. The study provides evidence that benefits do not ensure the
    perception of fair distributive justice, even for citizens with weak
    preferences. The findings inform current policies that introduce benefit
    schemes for wind energy projects to foster community acceptance and win over
    majority support for projects.

    Existing research offers a nuanced understanding of the conditions under
    which firms can gain a competitive advantage through environmental business
    conduct. However, we know quite little about whether such action can also
    generate benefits for firms induced by political action, such as benefits
    associated with public procurement, (softer) regulatory enforcement and
    corporate tax breaks. We argue that citizens are more likely to support such
    rewards for firms that have a stronger record of environmental business
    conduct, express stronger commitment to future environmental action and
    submit such action to independent audits. The empirical analysis focuses on
    vehicle emissions reduction by car producers and plastic waste reduction by
    retailers. Choice experiments with 6726 respondents from Germany and the
    United States support these arguments. Our findings are surprisingly
    consistent across two different sociocultural and political contexts
    (Germany, USA), two different environmental policy domains (vehicle
    emissions, plastic waste) and three forms of political rewards. Whereas
    studies focusing on narrowly defined economic benefits (competitiveness) of
    environmental business conduct have become somewhat more sceptical about the
    magnitude and scope of such benefits, our results provide more room for
    optimism by pointing to other types of benefits of corporate environmental
    action.

    Conjoint analysis is a common tool for studying political preferences. The
    method disentangles patterns in respondents’ favorability toward complex,
    multidimensional objects, such as candidates or policies. Most conjoints
    rely upon a fully randomized design to generate average marginal component e
    ects (AMCEs). They measure the degree to which a given value of a conjoint
    profile feature increases, or decreases, respondents’ support for the
    overall profile relative to a baseline, averaging across all respondents and
    other features. While the AMCE has a clear causal interpretation (about the
    e ect of features), most published conjoint analyses also use AMCEs to
    describe levels of favorability. This o en means comparing AMCEs among
    respondent subgroups. We show that using conditional AMCEs to describe the
    degree of subgroup agreement can be misleading as regression interactions
    are sensitive to the reference category used in the analysis. This leads to
    inferences about subgroup di erences in preferences that have arbitrary
    sign, size, and significance. We demonstrate the problem using examples
    drawn from published articles and provide suggestions for improved reporting
    and interpretation using marginal means and an omnibus F-test. Given the
    accelerating use of these designs in political science, we o er advice for
    best practice in analysis and presentation of results.

  title: Stated Choice Methods
  type: article-journal

- id: Louviere:2010
  abstract: >-
    We briefly review and discuss traditional conjoint analysis (CA) and
    discrete choice experiments (DCEs), widely used stated preference
    elicitation methods in several disciplines. We pay particular attention to
    the origins and basis of CA, and show that it is generally inconsistent with
    economic demand theory, and is subject to several logical inconsistencies
    that make it unsuitable for use in applied economics, particularly welfare
    and policy assessment. We contrast this with DCEs that have a long-standing,
    well-tested theoretical basis in random utility theory, and we show why and
    how DCEs are more general and consistent with economic demand theory.
    Perhaps the major message, though, is that many studies that claim to be
    doing conjoint analysis are really doing DCE.

    In principle, experiments offer a straightforward method for social
    scientists to accurately estimate causal effects. However, scholars often
    unwittingly distort treatment effect estimates by conditioning on variables
    that could be affected by their experimental manipulation. Typical examples
    include controlling for posttreatment variables in statistical models,
    eliminating observations based on posttreatment criteria, or subsetting the
    data based on posttreatment variables. Though these modeling choices are
    intended to address common problems encountered when conducting experiments,
    they can bias estimates of causal effects. Moreover, problems associated
    with conditioning on posttreatment variables remain largely unrecognized in
    the field, which we show frequently publishes experimental studies using
    these practices in our discipline's most prestigious journals. We
    demonstrate the severity of experimental posttreatment bias analytically and
    document the magnitude of the potential distortions it induces using
    visualizations and reanalyses of real-world data. We conclude by providing
    applied researchers with recommendations for best practice.

    Inherent in applied developmental sciences is the threat to validity and
    generalizability due to missing data as a result of participant drop-out.
    The current paper provides an overview of how attrition should be reported,
    which tests can examine the potential of bias due to attrition (e.g.,
    t-tests, logistic regression, Little's MCAR test, sensitivity analysis), and
    how it is best corrected through modern missing data analyses. To amend this
    discussion of best practices in managing and reporting attrition, an
    assessment of how developmental sciences currently handle attrition was
    conducted. Longitudinal studies (n = 541) published from 2009–2012 in major
    developmental journals were reviewed for attrition reporting practices and
    how authors handled missing data based on recommendations in the Publication
    Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA, 2010). Results
    suggest attrition reporting is not following APA recommendations, quality of
    reporting did not improve since the APA publication, and a low proportion of
    authors provided sufficient information to convey that data properly met the
    MAR assumption. An example based on simulated data demonstrates bias that
    may result from various missing data mechanisms in longitudinal data, the
    utility of auxiliary variables for the MAR assumption, and the need for
    viewing missingness along a continuum from MAR to MNAR.

    Progress in science relies in part on generating hypotheses with existing
    observations and testing hypotheses with new observations. This distinction
    between postdiction and prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not
    respected in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of
    predictions reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary
    biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid
    this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and
    analysis plan before observing the research outcomes—a process called
    preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that
    result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety
    of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of
    preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application,
    such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for
    preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the
    practice. Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase
    distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and
    will improve the credibility of research findings.

    <h2>Summary</h2><p>Disagreements persist on how to design a self-sufficient,
    carbon-neutral European energy system. To explore the diversity of design
    options, we develop a high-resolution model of the entire European energy
    system and produce 441 technically feasible system designs that are within
    10% of the optimal economic cost. We show that a wide range of systems based
    on renewable energy are feasible, with no need to import energy from outside
    Europe. Model solutions reveal considerable flexibility in the choice and
    geographical distribution of new infrastructure across the continent.
    Balanced renewable energy supply can be achieved either with or without
    mechanisms such as biofuel use, curtailment, and expansion of the
    electricity network. Trade-offs emerge once specific preferences are
    imposed. Low biofuel use, for example, requires heat electrification and
    controlled vehicle charging. This exploration of the impact of preferences
    on system design options is vital to inform urgent, politically difficult
    decisions for eliminating fossil fuel imports and achieving European carbon
    neutrality.</p>

    Thirty years of North American research on public acceptance of wind energy
    has produced important insights, yet knowledge gaps remain. This review
    synthesizes the literature, revealing the following lessons learned. (1)
    North American support for wind has been consistently high. (2) The NIMBY
    explanation for resistance to wind development is invalid. (3) Socioeconomic
    impacts of wind development are strongly tied to acceptance. (4) Sound and
    visual impacts of wind facilities are strongly tied to annoyance and
    opposition, and ignoring these concerns can exacerbate conflict. (5)
    Environmental concerns matter, though less than other factors, and these
    concerns can both help and hinder wind development. (6) Issues of fairness,
    participation, and trust during the development process influence
    acceptance. (7) Distance from turbines affects other explanatory variables,
    but alone its influence is unclear. (8) Viewing opposition as something to
    be overcome prevents meaningful understandings and implementation of best
    practices. (9) Implementation of research findings into practice has been
    limited. The paper also identifies areas for future research on wind
    acceptance. With continued research efforts and a commitment toward
    implementing research findings into developer and policymaker practice,
    conflict and perceived injustices around proposed and existing wind energy
    facilities might be significantly lessened.

    Coal-fired power generation is the single most important source of carbon
    dioxide emissions in many countries, including Germany. A government
    commission recently proposed to phase out coal by 2038, which implies that
    the country will miss its 2020 climate target. On the basis of a choice
    experiment that assessed 31,744 hypothetical policy scenarios in a
    representative sample of German voters, we show that voters prefer a
    phase-out by 2025. They would uphold their support for greater climate
    ambition up to an additional cost to society of (sic)8.5 billion. Voters in
    Rhineland and Lusatia, the country's main coal regions, also support an
    earlier phase-out, but to a lesser extent than voters in other regions. By
    demonstrating that political decision-makers are more reluctant than voters
    in overcoming energy path dependence, our analysis calls for further
    research to explain the influence of particular stakeholders in slowing
    energy transitions.

    Bayesian methods have become widespread in marketing literature. We review
    the essence of the Bayesian approach and explain why it is particularly
    useful for marketing problems. While the appeal of the Bayesian approach has
    long been noted by researchers, recent developments in computational methods
    and expanded availability of detailed marketplace data has fueled the growth
    in application of Bayesian methods in marketing. We emphasize the modularity
    and flexibility of modern Bayesian approaches. The usefulness of Bayesian
    methods in situations in which there is limited information about a large
    number of units or where the information comes from different sources is
    noted. We include an extensive discussion of open issues and directions for
    future research.

  abstract: "In response to the effects of climate change, many countries are realigning their energy systems to the principle of sustainability. An energy system change will lead to the development of substantial renewable energy infrastructure (mostly wind and photovoltaic) in landscapes with effects on perceived landscape quality and socio-political acceptance. Both direct perceptive effects of physical landscape structures and latent meanings associated with those structures potentially affect their acceptance. This work evaluates the role of landscape-technology fit (derived from place-technology fit) representing the extent to which alternatives within each of these two components “fit” together (e.g., does a given type of renewable energy infrastructure fit well within some landscapes but not others?). It also evaluates the role of latent meanings ascribed to landscapes and renewable energy infrastructure within that mentioned “fit” decision as well as the role of prior experience (exposure) to both. The study is based on a survey of Swiss citizens in a representative online panel (n\_=\_1062). To estimate preferences for diverse renewable energy infrastructure scenarios across landscape types, a discrete choice model was implemented. Meanings ascribed to landscapes and renewable energy infrastructure were included in a second component of the survey. An innovative hybrid choice model approach facilitated integration of latent and observed variables in a hierarchy of predictors. Results show that most effects were statistically significant. Landscape-technology fit functioned as a moderator between choice attributes and preferences; in turn, it is predicted by landscape and renewable energy meanings, which are predicted by relevant prior experience (exposure)."

  abstract: "We present stated preference data based on a national representative Swiss online panel survey related to preference of mixed renewable energy infrastructure in landscapes. Data were collected between November 2018 and March 2019 via an online questionnaire and yielded 1026 responses. The online questionnaire consisted of two main parts – (1) questions covering meanings related to landscapes, nature and renewable energy infrastructure and questions regarding the “fit” of landscape/renewable energy infrastructure (REI) combinations and (2) a stated choice experiment. While in the first part of the questionnaire we asked respondents about their personal connection to certain landscapes, to nature and to specific REI, we also asked them to evaluate the fitting of seven different Swiss landscapes (near natural alpine areas, northern alps, touristic alpine areas, agricultural plateau, urban plateau, Jura ridges, urban alpine valley) with five different REI (wind, PV ground/agricultural, PV ground/other, PV roof, power lines) combinations. In the second part of the questionnaire, the stated choice experiment confronted respondents with 15 consecutive choice tasks, with each task involving a choice between two “energy system transformation” options and an opt-out option (none). Each choice option (beside the opt-out option) included four unlabeled attributes (landscape, wind energy infrastructure, photovoltaic energy infrastructure, high voltage overhead power line infrastructure) with varying levels. Due to data cleaning procedures (item nonresponse) the number of responses used within hybrid choice modeling and analysis was n\_=\_844 (12,660 choice observations). An analysis of the hybrid choice model and further insights are presented in the article “How landscape-technology fit affects public evaluations of renewable energy infrastructure scenarios. A hybrid choice model.”"

    This paper examines how mixes (wind, PV, power lines) of different renewable
    energy infrastructure (REI) impact people's preferences for various
    landscape types. This does not only involve the visual character but also
    meanings that are assigned to these landscapes, which together influence the
    perceived landscape quality. The research is based on a representative
    online panel survey of Swiss residents (n = 1062). A discrete choice model
    (15 choice tasks) was implemented to estimate people's preferences for
    different REI scenarios across several landscape types. Hierarchical Bayes
    analysis allowed us to analyze preferences of the different respondents,
    while choice simulation allowed us to estimate preferences for every
    potential scenario (n = 224) of the discrete choice experiment. While the
    results show a heterogeneous picture of people's preferences, they also
    reveal common general patterns. Near-natural mid/high-elevation landscapes
    in the Alps are clearly rejected for REI implementation. Landscapes
    dominated by settlements or intensive agricultural use and landscapes in
    mountain tourist areas are preferably selected for REI developments. REI
    scenarios including overhead power lines perform consistently lower than
    scenarios without power lines. Overall, high preferences for scenarios with
    low REI indicate that society still lacks awareness of the need for massive
    REI implementation to achieve a sustainable energy transition.

    Statistical modeling is a powerful tool for developing and testing theories
    by way of causal explanation, prediction, and description. In many
    disciplines there is near-exclusive use of statistical modeling for causal
    explanation and the assumption that models with high explanatory power are
    inherently of high predictive power. Conflation between explanation and
    prediction is common, yet the distinction must be understood for progressing
    scientific knowledge. While this distinction has been recognized in the
    philosophy of science, the statistical literature lacks a thorough
    discussion of the many differences that arise in the process of modeling for
    an explanatory versus a predictive goal. The purpose of this article is to
    clarify the distinction between explanatory and predictive modeling, to
    discuss its sources, and to reveal the practical implications of the
    distinction to each step in the modeling process.

    In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite
    empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive
    findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting
    dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a
    researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists
    than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer
    simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how
    unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant
    evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and
    straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The
    solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines
    for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication
    process.

    <h2>Summary</h2><p>Local resistance often hinders renewable energy
    technology developments, especially for onshore wind. In decentralized
    energy systems, the landscape impact of wind turbines or transmission lines
    is a key barrier to public acceptance. By using landscape scenicness as a
    proxy for public acceptance, we quantify its impact on the optimal energy
    systems of 11,131 German municipalities. In municipalities with high
    scenicness, it is likely that onshore wind will be rejected, leading to
    higher levelized costs of energy by up to about 7 €-cent/kWh. Onshore wind
    would be replaced mainly by solar photovoltaics and imports, and the
    cost-optimal energy systems would be associated with higher CO~2~ emissions
    of up to about 200 gCO~2~/kWh compared with an average of around 50
    gCO~2~/kWh. The findings help to identify municipalities where public
    resistance to onshore wind could be particularly high and support the
    scientific and policy debate about the location of onshore wind farms.</p>

    It is common to present multiple adjusted effect estimates from a single
    model in a single table. For example, a table might show odds ratios for one
    or more exposures and also for several confounders from a single logistic
    regression. This can lead to mistaken interpretations of these estimates. We
    use causal diagrams to display the sources of the problems. Presentation of
    exposure and confounder effect estimates from a single model may lead to
    several interpretative difficulties, inviting confusion of direct-effect
    estimates with total-effect estimates for covariates in the model. These
    effect estimates may also be confounded even though the effect estimate for
    the main exposure is not confounded. Interpretation of these effect
    estimates is further complicated by heterogeneity (variation, modification)
    of the exposure effect measure across covariate levels. We offer suggestions
    to limit potential misunderstandings when multiple effect estimates are
    presented, including precise distinction between total and direct effect
    measures from a single model, and use of multiple models tailored to yield
    total-effect estimates for covariates.

    Public support is usually a precondition for the adoption and successful
    implementation of costly policies. We argue that such support is easier to
    achieve with policy-packages that incorporate primary and ancillary
    measures. We specifically distinguish command-andcontrol and market-based
    measures as primary measures and argue that the former will usually garner
    more public support than the latter given the low-visibility tendency of
    costs associated with command-and-control measures. Nevertheless, if
    included in a policypackage, ancillary measures are likely to increase
    public support by reducing negative effects of primary measures. Based on a
    choice experiment with a representative sample of 2,034 Swiss citizens, we
    assessed these arguments with respect to political efforts to reduce vehicle
    emissions. The empirical analysis supported the argument that
    policypackaging affects public support positively, particularly generating
    more support when ancillary measures are added. Lastly, we ultimately
    observe that command-and-control measures obtain more public support than
    market-based instruments.
