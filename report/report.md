## H1 {#sec:H1}

## H2: People value ownership higher than prices. {#sec:H2}

There is no formal way to test this hypothesis. Likely, it does not hold.

We could test this hypothesis by comparing the magnitude of the effect sizes of the attributes. Doing so, ownership's largest effect size is <5% (from public to private), and prices' largest effect size is ~30% (from +0% to +60%) (@fig:H2). We must not forget that these effect sizes are somewhat arbitrary, as they are based on our arbitrary choice of levels. Still, as the effecct sizes differ quite a lot, we can likely reject this hypothesis.

## H4 {#sec:H4}

## H5 {#sec:H5}

## H6: People in urban areas show a higher preference for land requirements than people from rural areas. {#sec:H6}

The data do not support this hypothesis.

I am using the method to measure subgroup preferences described by @Leeper:2020. I remove all respondents that gave no answer to the question about their area. I then calculate differences in marginal means between the urban and the rural population for all attribute levels. All differences including the one about land requirements are very small (@fig:H6) and only for two levels (unrelated to land requirements) can be reject the null hypothesis that there is an effect.

## H8 {#sec:H8}

## H9 {#sec:H9}

## H10 {#sec:H10}

## H11: People in wealthy countries show a stronger preference for local generation infrastructure. {#sec:H11}

The data support this hypothesis.

I am using the method to measure subgroup preferences described by @Leeper:2020. I then calculate conditional marginal means for all attribute levels.

Country GDP per capita leads to the following order of countries (Worldbank data):

1. Denmark ($56000)
2. Germany ($41000)
3. Portugal ($20000)
4. Poland ($15000)

Germany has the highest preference for no imports, followed by Denmark, Portugal, and Poland (@fig:H11). Some of these differences are statistically significant.

Germany has the lowest preference for 90% imports, followed by Denmark, Portugal, and Poland (@fig:H11). Some of these differences are statistically significant.

## H12: People in countries with high deployment levels of renewables show a stronger preference for local generation infrastructure. {#sec:H12}

The data support this hypothesis.

We define deployment levels as the ratio of deployment of solar and wind renewables (IRENA, 2019) to electricity demand taken from @Trondle:2019.

Deployment:

Denmark  6117 +    1079 =   7196 MW
Germany  60840 +  49018 = 109858 MW
Poland   5917 +    1300 =   7217 MW
Portugal 5233 +     842 =   6075 MW

Demand:

* Germany  (493 TWh yr^-1^)
* Denmark  ( 33 TWh yr^-1^)
* Poland   (168 TWh yr^-1^)
* Portugal ( 50 TWh yr^-1^)

Leads to the following country ranking:

1. Germany  223 MW TWh^-1^ yr^1^
2. Denmark  218 MW TWh^-1^ yr^1^
3. Portugal 122 MW TWh^-1^ yr^1^
4. Poland    43 MW TWh^-1^ yr^1^

Germany has highest deployment and highest preferences, followed by Denmark, Portugal, and Poland.

## H13: People in countries with low population density show a stronger preference for local generation infrastructure. {#sec:H13}

The data do not support this hypothesis.

Population density of the four countries (Wikipedia):

1. Portugal (112 km^-2^)
2. Poland (123 km^-2^)
3. Denmark (138 km^-2^)
4. Germany (232 km^-2^)

This is in analogy to H11, however the country ranking is almost completely inverted. The conditional marginal means indicate the exact opposite (fig:H11).

## H14: People in resource-rich countries show a stronger preference for local generation infrastructure. {#sec:H14}

The data do not support this hypothesis.

We define resource-richness as the ratio of generation potential to electricity demand. Data taken from @Trondle:2019. The method is in analogy to H11.

* Germany  (1 183 and 493 TWh yr^-1^)
* Denmark  (  509 and  33 TWh yr^-1^)
* Poland   (  548 and 168 TWh yr^-1^)
* Portugal (  363 and  50 TWh yr^-1^)

Leads to the following ranking of resource-richness:

1. Denmark  (15.4)
2. Portugal ( 7.2)
3. Poland   ( 3.3)
4. Germany  ( 2.4)

Germany shows higher preference for local generation infrastructure than Portugal and Poland, but has fewer resources (@fig:H11). Denmark has by far the best resources and generally rather high preferences, but the two are not in proportion.
