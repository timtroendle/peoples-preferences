# Introduction

The following is an in-depth analysis of our choice experiment results with ~1000 respondents from each of the four countries: Germany, Poland, Denmark, Portugal.

# Cluster analysis of respondents

I performed a cluster analysis in the hope to find groups of respondents that reveal different preferences. The hope was that these groups could be formed based on demographic data. In short: this is not the case.

I found that the most important demographic attributes are country, gender, and area (urban/rural). Apparently, German males living in cities are very similar; as are Polish females living in the countryside, and all other possible combinations of the three attributes (@fig:umap_gender, @fig:umap_area, @fig:umap_country).

I used the following ten attributes:

* gender,
* birth year,
* area
* renewables in region,
* years living in region,
* education,
* income,
* climate concern,
* party (aggregated to green/right-wing/others),
* country.

![**Two-dimensional projection of the ten-dimensional demographic attribute space of all respondents with gender color-coded.**](build/clustering/4-with-country/umap-Q3_GENDER.png){#fig:umap_gender}

![**Two-dimensional projection of the ten-dimensional demographic attribute space of all respondents with area color-coded.**](build/clustering/4-with-country/umap-Q6_AREA.png){#fig:umap_area}

![**Two-dimensional projection of the ten-dimensional demographic attribute space of all respondents with country color-coded.**](build/clustering/4-with-country/umap-RESPONDENT_COUNTRY.png){#fig:umap_country}

When I group the respondents into four cluster, the clusters will be formed along country/gender/area lines (@fig:umap). Cluster one contains the rural population in Germany, Denmark, and Portugal; cluster two contains the urban population in Germany and Portugal; cluster three contains the urban population in Denmark, and cluster four contains the Polish population.

![**Two-dimensional projection of the ten-dimensional demographic attribute space of all respondents with clusters color-coded.**](build/clustering/4-with-country/umap.png){#fig:umap}

We can also form more and smaller clusters. For example, I tried to form 16 clusters (4 countries, 2 gender, 2 areas; not shown here). This will literally allow us to compare German urban males to Polish rural females. The differences in preferences aren't huge though, and the biggest effect stemming again from Poland.
