# Introduction

The following is a brief analysis of our results with ~1000 respondents from each of the four countries: Germany, Poland, Denmark, Portugal.

# Hypotheses

## H6: People in urban areas show a higher preference for land requirements than people from rural areas

The data do not support this hypothesis.

I am using the method to measure subgroup preferences described by @Leeper:2020. I remove all respondents that gave no answer to the question about their area. I then calculate differences in marginal means between the urban and the rural population for all attribute levels. All differences including the one about land requirements are very small (@fig:H6) and only for two levels (unrelated to land requirements) can be reject the null hypothesis that there is an effect.
